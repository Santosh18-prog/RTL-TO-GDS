# 🚀 RTL to GDSII Implementation using OpenLANE  
### VSD Squadron – RTL to GDS Flow

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository documents my hands-on implementation of the complete **RTL to GDSII ASIC design flow** using the OpenLANE framework as part of the VSD Squadron program.

The goal of this project is to convert a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design into a manufacturable GDSII layout while ensuring:

- ✅ No Design Rule Check (DRC) violations  
- ✅ No Layout vs Schematic (LVS) mismatches  
- ✅ No Timing Violations  
- ✅ Clean final GDSII output  

This project demonstrates understanding of modern ASIC Physical Design using open-source EDA tools.

## 🏗️ Complete RTL to GDSII Flow

```
RTL → Synthesis → Floorplanning → Placement → CTS → Routing → Signoff → GDSII
```

---

## 🔹 1️⃣ RTL Synthesis

- Converts RTL (Verilog) into a gate-level netlist
- Maps logic to Standard Cell Library (Sky130 SCL)
- Performs logic optimization
- Generates synthesized netlist

**Tool Used:** Yosys (via OpenLANE)

---

## 🔹 2️⃣ Floorplanning

- Defines die area and core area
- IO pin placement
- Power planning (VDD/VSS distribution)
- Macro placement (if present)

**Objective:**
- Efficient silicon utilization  
- Robust power distribution  
- Minimal congestion  

---

## 🔹 3️⃣ Placement

- Global Placement
- Detailed Placement
- Post-placement optimization

**Goals:**
- Minimize wirelength  
- Improve timing slack  
- Reduce congestion  

---

## 🔹 4️⃣ Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

- Creates clock distribution network
- Inserts buffers to reduce skew
- Balances clock latency across flip-flops

**Objective:**  
Ensure stable and synchronized clock delivery to all sequential elements.

---

## 🔹 5️⃣ Routing

- Global Routing
- Detailed Routing
- Metal layer interconnections

**Handles:**

- Congestion management  
- Antenna violations  
- Signal optimization  

---

## 🔹 6️⃣ Antenna Rule Fixing

Metal wires during fabrication can accumulate charge and damage transistor gates.

**Solutions implemented:**

- Antenna diode insertion  
- Layer hopping (bridging)  
- Automatic antenna checking using Magic  

---

## 🔹 7️⃣ Signoff Verification

### ✅ Physical Verification

- **DRC (Design Rule Check)** – Magic  
- **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)** – Magic + Netgen  

### ✅ Timing Verification

- Static Timing Analysis (STA)  
- Tool: OpenSTA  

### ✅ Parasitic Extraction

- RC extraction (SPEF generation)  
- Tool: Magic  

---

## 🔹 8️⃣ Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)

Ensures functional equivalence between:

- Pre-CTS netlist  
- Post-CTS netlist  
- Post-routing netlist  

Verifies that optimizations do not alter logical functionality.
